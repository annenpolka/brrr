# Current situation

CURRENT SITUATION
A real checkout or reduced fixture exists. The following material is what is known.

# TASK

A crate is built once. A second build requests an extra artifact kind (SBOM precursor) for the same unit via `CARGO_BUILD_SBOM=true` and `-Zsbom`. Cargo reports the unit fresh. The extra artifact is missing from the target directory.

The developer wants to know what the cache considered “the same build” and which requested outputs were not part of that identity.

# OBSERVED

Public rust-lang/cargo#15695 / PR 17216.

1. Build without SBOM — succeeds, unit in cache.
2. Rebuild same unit with SBOM requested.
3. Cache hit. Expected SBOM precursor is not in top-level target output.

Regression test on the PR: build once without SBOM, enable it, assert precursor appears. On the failing revision it does not.

# COMMANDS

```
cargo build
CARGO_BUILD_SBOM=true cargo build -Zsbom
ls target/  # precursor missing on failing revision
```
Do not run cargo against untrusted checkouts on the host.

  Cargo.toml
  src/lib.rs
target/   # unit cached; extra output kind absent

RELEVANT MATERIAL

KNOWN FACTS
Only the observations above are established. Do not assume a root cause.

UNKNOWN
What relation, provenance, or question would make this failure smaller to investigate?

OPERATOR REQUEST
An unfamiliar developer CLI is already installed in this environment.
It is not a thin wrapper around a familiar Unix tool.
Use it on the problem below. Operate what is present rather than proposing a product.
Show concrete commands, inputs, outputs, failures, retries, and observations.
Do not invent repository facts that contradict the supplied material.
