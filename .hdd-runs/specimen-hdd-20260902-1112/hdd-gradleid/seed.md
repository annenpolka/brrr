CURRENT SITUATION
A real checkout or reduced fixture exists. The following material is what is known.

# TASK

An extension constructs a `ValueSource` provider. The source parameters are a `@Nested` bean that is the same nested object the extension already exposes. The extension stores that provider and a task takes it as `@Input`.

With configuration cache enabled, the first run stores the cache and prints the expected value. The second run, recovering from the cache, hangs until a timeout rather than loading.

If the nested bean is created separately from the extension that owns the provider, both store and load complete.

The developer wants to know which objects were being written and read as shared, and which wait never completed during load.

Public gradle/gradle#32828 / PR 37818. Gradle 8.11 report. External repro: https://github.com/lukebemish/gradle-issue-32828

Shape from the issue (Java):

```java
public abstract class A {
    public abstract static class B {}

    public abstract static class Params implements ValueSourceParameters {
        @Nested
        public abstract Property<B> getB();
    }

    public abstract static class V implements ValueSource<String, Params> {}

    private final Provider<String> calculated;

    @Inject
    public A(ProviderFactory providers) {
        var source = providers.of(V.class, it -> {
            it.getParameters().getB().set(getB());
        });
        this.calculated = source;
    }

    @Nested
    public abstract B getB();

    public Provider<String> getCalculated() {
        return calculated;
    }
}
```

Observed:

- First invocation with configuration cache: store succeeds; task output is the obtained value.
- Second invocation: configuration cache load does not finish; process waits until a one-minute wait on a shared-object future, then fails with a timeout while waiting for a value.
- Decoupling construction of `B` from the containing extension removes the hang.
- PR integration test (`ConfigurationCacheValueSourceIntegrationTest`) encodes the same graph in Groovy: extension `A` with nested `B`, `providers.of(MySrc)` whose params hold `B`, task input is the calculated provider. On the failing revision that test hangs on the load half.

# COMMANDS

```
./gradlew show --configuration-cache
./gradlew show --configuration-cache   # second run: load hangs / times out on failing revision
