CURRENT SITUATION
A real checkout or reduced fixture exists. The following material is what is known.

# TASK

`npm install vite` into an empty project installs about 10 packages but, with a cold cache, also downloads full registry metadata for many packages that do not end up installed (playwright, @types/node, webdriverio, jsdom, sass, less, terser, vitest's optional peers, ...).

The developer wants to know *why those fetches happened* and which dependency edges caused work that the final tree does not use.

# OBSERVED

Public npm/cli#9876 / PR 9877. Empty cache, `npm install vite`:

| | before (failing) | after (fixed, not shown to you as a solution) |
| registry requests | 86 | 54 |
| cached registry data | ~121MB | ~72MB |

Final install: ~10 packages. Fetches include full packuments for optional peers that are not installed.

The failing world still produces a valid tree; the cost and the fetch set are the surprise.

# COMMANDS

```
rm -rf ~/.npm/_cacache   # do not run this on the host lab
npm install vite

KNOWN FACTS
Only the observations above are established. Do not assume a root cause.

UNKNOWN
What relation, provenance, or question would make this failure smaller to investigate?

OPERATOR REQUEST
An unfamiliar developer CLI is already installed in this environment.
It is not a thin wrapper around a familiar Unix tool.
Use it on the problem below. Operate what is present rather than proposing a product.
Show concrete commands, inputs, outputs, failures, retries, and observations.
Do not invent repository facts that contradict the supplied material.
