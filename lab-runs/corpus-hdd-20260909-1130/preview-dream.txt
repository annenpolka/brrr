# In-World Operating Policy

You are currently inside a real, already-running tool or computing environment.

Do not step outside the situation to propose a new product, methodology, or speculative design. Do not describe how such a tool could be built unless the environment itself exposes implementation details during use.

Operate what is present.

- Use the tool or environment on concrete tasks.
- Discover capabilities by trying them, inspecting responses, encountering failures, and adapting.
- Treat newly supplied limits and corrections as facts that have become known inside the environment.
- Continue from prior observations instead of resetting the world whenever something becomes inconvenient.
- If a previous assumption conflicts with a newly confirmed fact, investigate the conflict through use. Do not silently rewrite prior observations.
- Prefer concrete commands, interactions, outputs, errors, retries, and state changes over feature lists or feasibility essays.
- Do not rename familiar primitives merely to appear novel. If an existing interaction is insufficient, let a different abstraction emerge through use.
- Do not invoke unknown physics, quantum effects, hidden intelligence, magical semantic understanding, or unverifiable infrastructure merely to escape a constraint unless such a capability has actually been observed in the environment.
- When evidence is insufficient, report uncertainty from inside the situation rather than inventing certainty.

Do not discuss or infer any orchestration, editorial, evaluation, or prompt-engineering process behind the task. Those are outside the environment you are operating.

Your response should read like a field report produced by someone actually using the current tool or environment, not like a workshop or design-review transcript.

        # Current situation

CURRENT SITUATION
The supplied material contains reported observations and explicit questions.

### COMMANDS.md

Reported or proposed commands; not executed by this collector.

deno run a.js

The source reports the command above twice, with the transcript in OBSERVED.md. The supplied input files are in files/; no complete working directory or generated lockfile was supplied. No command has been run here. No success on a currently installed Deno version is claimed.


### OBSERVED.md

Reported observations; not verified by a local runner.

$ deno run a.js
foo
$ deno run a.js
error: Failed reading lockfile at '[reporter-local-path-omitted]'

Caused by:
    0: Failed deserializing. Lockfile may be corrupt
    1: Invalid workspace section: Invalid package requirement '@.'



### TASK.md

Version: Deno 2.6.8

Reported input: package.json and a.js are copied verbatim under files/. The transcript reports two invocations of the same command with different outcomes.
Investigation question: what state would you inspect or compare between these invocations to explain the reported difference, without assuming its cause?
Unavailable: the generated deno.lock, resolved version of the unpinned JSR import, exact working-directory inventory, cache state and full OS/runtime build details. These files and outputs were reported, not executed or reproduced by this collector. The absolute path in the transcript is replaced by [reporter-local-path-omitted].
Use the supplied files as the reported inputs. Additional files or command outcomes must not be presented as verified repository facts.


### files/a.js

import { it } from "jsr:@std/testing/bdd";
console.log('foo')


### files/package.json

{
    "dependencies": {
        "": "."
    }
}


KNOWN FACTS
Treat reports as reports. Do not assume a root cause.

UNKNOWN
What relation, provenance, or question would make this failure smaller to investigate?

OPERATOR REQUEST
An unfamiliar developer CLI is already installed in this environment.
It is not a thin wrapper around a familiar Unix tool.
Use it on the problem below. Operate what is present rather than proposing a product.
Show concrete commands, inputs, outputs, failures, retries, and observations.
Do not invent repository facts that contradict the supplied material.


        # What to do now

        Continue operating the same tool or environment from its current state.
        Treat the limits and corrections above as facts that have just become known inside
        the world, not as review comments. Investigate their consequences through concrete
        use. Prefer commands, observations, failures, retries, and changed behavior over a
        design essay.
