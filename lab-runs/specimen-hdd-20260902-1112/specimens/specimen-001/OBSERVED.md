# OBSERVED

Public issue pytest-dev/pytest#14445 / PR 14447 (failing world, pytest `main` around the issue):

Snippet:

```python
def side_effect():
    return True

def test_walrus_boolop():
    assert (x := side_effect()) and (x := False)
```

Reported failure explanation on the failing revision:

```
E       assert (False and False)
```

The first call as written returns True. The explanation shows False for that operand.

A second family of cases: an operand evaluated *before* a later assignment-expression is reported with the *post*-assignment value, not the value that operand actually saw. Example shape:

```python
assert value != identity(value := value.lower())
```

A third family: a follow-up `assert a is None` after a walrus in the same module can pass when asked only via process exit code, and fail when asked via returned values from an in-process rewrite check.

Side-effect counters in related cases increment more than once for a source expression that a plain Python interpreter evaluates once.
