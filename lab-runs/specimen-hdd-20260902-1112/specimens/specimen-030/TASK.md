# TASK

A checkout of pytest-rerunfailures sits at 0440e2158c98187a6ccd283e9c0b65475d1cd620.

The plugin re-runs a failed test item up to N times. A class-based test is marked `@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=5)`. An autouse fixture and the test body both write to `self`. Pytest otherwise gives each test item its own class instance.

The developer is trying to understand why a rerun of the same test method does not start from a clean `self`, while a later sibling method in the same class does.

Outcome sought: determine what is shared across attempts of one item, what is reset, and what a rerun of a class method actually reuses.
