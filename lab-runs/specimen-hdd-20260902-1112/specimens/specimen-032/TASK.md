# TASK

A Django checkout sits at cd7554e5517992d5ca2594ffc936cb193daab26c.

Site cache is enabled with the documented two-part middleware order:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware",
]
```

A view returns an `HttpResponse` whose `Cache-Control` is `no-store` and whose body includes `datetime.datetime.now()`. A second GET to the same URL still returns the first timestamp.

A related path uses the `cache_page` decorator (built from `CacheMiddleware`, which subclasses both update and fetch classes). Existing tests show `Cache-Control: private` is not stored. `no-store` / `no-cache` were not in that test.

Outcome sought: why `private` and `no-store` diverge under this middleware pair, and what the second request is actually serving.
