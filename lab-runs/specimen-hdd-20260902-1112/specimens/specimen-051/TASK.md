# TASK

An extension constructs a `ValueSource` provider. The source parameters are a `@Nested` bean that is the same nested object the extension already exposes. The extension stores that provider and a task takes it as `@Input`.

With configuration cache enabled, the first run stores the cache and prints the expected value. The second run, recovering from the cache, hangs until a timeout rather than loading.

If the nested bean is created separately from the extension that owns the provider, both store and load complete.

The developer wants to know which objects were being written and read as shared, and which wait never completed during load.
